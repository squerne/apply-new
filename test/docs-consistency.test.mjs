// Defect-to-test: every one of these was first caught by hand.
//
// 1. The slash command's narrative.json schema lagged behind the fields
//    assembleProfile actually consumes (ai_relationship and intensity were
//    missing — the model only wrote them by accident).
// 2. The slash command quoted a CLI output string ("… rappresentativi: …")
//    that the CLI no longer prints (output was translated to English).
// 3. The slash command used a REAL repo name of a real candidate as its
//    example repoLabel — a proper-name leak in the public repo of a tool
//    whose privacy rule is "counts, not names".
