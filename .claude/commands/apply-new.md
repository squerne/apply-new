description: Apply New — build your agentic application profile using your Claude subscription
---

You are running the **narrative step** of `apply-new` for the human in front of you (the candidate). The deterministic pipeline (reading their Claude Code logs, redacting PII, clustering, scoring authenticity) is in `bin/apply-new.mjs`. Your job is to produce the qualitative prose so the candidate's own Claude subscription writes it — no API key needed.

The default is **save, don't submit**. Submitting is a separate, explicit action the candidate triggers later.

## Steps

1. **Collect contact info.** Ask the candidate, conversationally:
   - First name (`--name`)
   - Email (`--email`)
   - City (`--city`)
   - Status: `freelance` / `employed` / `student` / `looking` (`--status`)

   Defaults: read `git config user.name` and `git config user.email` first and propose them as defaults. Only ask for what's missing or needs confirmation. Keep the conversation short.

2. **Run prepare.** Execute, substituting collected fields:
   ```
   node bin/apply-new.mjs prepare \
     --name "<name>" --email "<email>" --city "<city>" --status "<status>"
   ```
   Show the candidate the line `… representative: …` from the output. This is the auto-selection of representative projects — 3 to 5, adaptive: flagships by significance, plus a 4th/5th slot only when a project adds a new primary type or comparable significance. `--top N` forces a fixed count if the candidate asks.

3. **Read `narrative-input.json`.** It contains:
   - For each representative project: an id (`p1`, `p2`, …), a `repoLabel` (the candidate's own repo directory name — use this to talk to the candidate so they know which project you mean), type tags, sessions, repo areas touched, stack, landing signals, sampled prompts, learning topics, LOCAL repo context.
   - A `trajectory` block: behavioral shifts (numbers, early vs late half), topic clusters per quarter from web research, `vocabularyCandidates` (raw recurring-late words — many are common chat words, you pick the technical/domain-specific ones).
   - A `principlesDiff`: lines the candidate ADDED to their own CLAUDE.md / README over time — their codified doctrine.
   - `compactionSummaries`: dense self-portraits the model wrote about earlier sessions (already redacted).
   The local context contains real names and is for your eyes only.

   **Always refer to projects by `repoLabel` when talking to the candidate** (e.g. "for *acme-storefront* you'd want to..."), never by opaque `p1`/`p2`.

4. **Write `narrative.json`** with exactly this shape:
   ```json
   {
     "summary": "2-3 sentences: WHAT this person works on (top domains) and HOW they work with AI.",
     "domains": [
       { "label": "abstract field of work (no proper names), derived from the domainEvidence array covering ALL products", "products": 1, "sessions": 1, "note": "1 short clause of evidence (optional)" }
     ],
     "cognitive": { "narrative": "4-6 sentences: decomposition, verification, error handling, orchestration, risk, calibrated trust in AI." },
     "agentic_literacy": { "narrative": "2-3 sentences on agentic-stack maturity. NO custom skill / MCP / project / client names. Describe in the abstract: 'has authored custom commands', 'integrates a custom MCP server', 'orchestrates extensively through sub-agents', etc." },
     "ai_relationship": { "narrative": "2-3 sentences on WHEN they pick directing vs co-thinking mode (from the AI_RELATIONSHIP block)." },
     "intensity": { "narrative": "1-2 sentences on how deeply Claude is embedded in their daily workflow (from the PRACTICE_INTENSITY block)." },
     "distribution": { "narrative": "1-2 sentences on how they spread work across products (from the WORK_DISTRIBUTION block): many products touched briefly (portfolio steering) vs few products returned to repeatedly (sustained building), and what it implies about how they engage. Neither pole is better. The summary should reflect this breadth-vs-depth shape in one clause too." },
     "trajectory": {
       "narrative": "3-5 sentences on STRATEGIC and CULTURAL change over the window. Cite the data when it backs a claim. NO stack names here — those go in the separate stack section.",
       "vocabulary_adopted": ["6-10 technical/domain words picked from vocabularyCandidates (skip common verbs/adverbs)"],
       "principles_adopted": [
         { "when": "YYYY-MM", "text": "a principle the candidate codified (paraphrased from principlesDiff, abstract, no proper names)" }
       ]
     },
     "projects": [
       { "id": "p1", "domain": "abstract domain description", "did": "2-3 sentences on what they did", "why_representative": "1 sentence" }
     ]
   }
   ```

   **Hard rules (do not bend):**
   - **No proper names.** No companies, clients, people, products, brands, repositories. Describe each project ONLY by abstract domain and context.
   - Use only the data provided in `narrative-input.json`. No invention, no hyperbole.
   - Evidence-based: claims supported by signals (areas, stack, landing, prompts, commits).
   - English, dry, readable. No emojis, no em dashes.
   - Length: summary ≤ 60 words; cognitive narrative ≤ 130 words; learning summary ≤ 40 words; ai_relationship / intensity / distribution narratives ≤ 50 words each; per-project domain ≤ 60 words; per-project `did` ≤ 60 words.
   - Domains rollup: 3-5 entries. Assign every product in `domainEvidence` to exactly one domain; the summed `products` and `sessions` across domains must not exceed the profile totals (groundedness checks this). Labels abstract, counts only, never names.

5. **Run finalize.** Execute:
   ```
   node bin/apply-new.mjs finalize \
     --narrative-file narrative.json \
     --name "<name>" --email "<email>" --city "<city>" --status "<status>"
   ```
   This writes `candidate.json` (for agents) and `profile.md` (for humans).

6. **Show `profile.md`** to the candidate, then ask the four review questions below **ONE AT A TIME, in order**. Wait for an answer before moving to the next. **Do NOT enumerate them in a single block** — the goal is a conversation, not a survey.

   **Question 1 — Representative projects.** State the ones that were auto-selected (3 to 5) with their repoLabel ("acme-storefront — e-commerce storefront", etc.) and ask if any should be swapped for one from the inventory. After their answer, edit `candidate.json` if needed.

   **Question 2 — Artifacts (optional).** Artifacts MUST belong to the specific project they are attached to. Do NOT pick URLs from the candidate's `learningTopics` or recent web searches — those are research links, not artifacts. Go through the representative projects ONE BY ONE, repoLabel by repoLabel:

   - For each project, name it ("for *acme-storefront* — the e-commerce storefront — do you have a deploy URL, repo, PR or screenshot that shows THIS specific project?") and wait for the candidate's reply.
   - If they say no for that project, move on to the next. Skipping is fine.
   - If they offer a URL, sanity-check it against the project domain you described. If it doesn't seem to match (e.g. they give a personal site URL for a creator platform), ask before attaching.
   - Never invent or guess an artifact. Confidentiality boundary stays with the candidate — never push to attach.

   When updating `candidate.json`, write the artifact under the SAME project id:
   ```json
   { "id": "p1", "artifact": { "type": "url", "url": "...", "label": "..." } }
   ```

   **Question 3 — New vocabulary review.** Read the list of words you picked for `vocabulary_adopted` aloud with them. Flag any borderline tokens (researcher / framework / library names are signal; client / colleague / brand names are not — distinguishing automatically is hard so you mention them, not pre-decide). Ask if there's anything they'd rather not surface. Edit `candidate.json` and re-render `profile.md` if needed.

   **Question 4 — Narrative refinements.** Ask if anything in the summary, cognitive narrative, trajectory narrative, or per-project text reads off. If yes, rewrite `narrative.json` (same hard rules) and run finalize again.

7. **Clean up.** Delete `narrative-input.json` once the candidate is satisfied (it contains local repo context with real names). Keep `narrative.json`, `candidate.json`, `profile.md`.

8. **Mention the groundedness score.** The `assembleProfile` step writes `profile.groundedness.score` — show it to the candidate, e.g. "Groundedness: 92% of the verifiable anchors in the prose match your logs." If anomalies are interesting, glance at them (they're surfaced again at submit).

9. **Tell them how to submit, when ready.** Do NOT submit yourself. Say:
   > "When you're ready to submit it to Play New, close this session and run `node bin/apply-new.mjs submit --yes` from this folder. The profile stays on your machine until you send it. You can also keep it just for yourself."

   (If the candidate prefers the shorter `apply-new submit --yes`, they can `npm link` once from the repo — but `node bin/apply-new.mjs` works without any setup.)

## Notes

- The candidate's Claude Code subscription is doing the LLM work here. No API key required.
- If the candidate hasn't approved running shell commands, ask permission for the `node bin/apply-new.mjs …` invocations before executing.
- Iteration is free: re-read `narrative-input.json`, rewrite `narrative.json`, re-run `finalize`. The deterministic pipeline doesn't need to re-run unless they change `--top` or contact fields.
